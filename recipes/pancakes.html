    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pancake is a thin, flat, circular piece of cooked batter made from milk, flour, and eggs. 
       Pancakes are often rolled up or folded and eaten hot with a sweet or savoury filling inside. 
       In America, pancakes are usually eaten for breakfast, with butter and maple syrup.</p>
