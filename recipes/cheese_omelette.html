    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
       An egg dish made with two or three beaten eggs that are cooked until they set and then eaten as a 
       flat or folded serving of food. Commonly served folded, the Omelet can be prepared as a plain Omelet
       served flat or one that is folded in half or folded into a rounded and somewhat tucked shape. 
       The shape of the folded Omelet will often depend on how many and the type of additional ingredients 
       that may become a stuffing or a topping for flat or folded Omelets. Many different ingredients can 
       be used for the fillings, including cheese.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of milk, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup shredded Emmentaler cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; add milk and season with salt and white pepper.
            Whisk until egg mixture is foamy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

        <li>Melt butter in a small, nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 
            Pour in egg mixture and swirl the skillet, so the bottom is evenly covered with egg. 
            Cook until egg starts to set, about 1 minute. Lift edges with a spatula and tilt the
            skillet so uncooked egg can flow towards the bottom of the skillet to set. 
            Repeat until no visible liquid egg remains.</li>
            
        <li>Carefully flip omelette; cook until warmed through, 30 seconds to 1 minute. 
            Sprinkle Emmentaler cheese down the middle of omelette; fold in half. 
            Cook until cheese is melted, about 20 seconds. Slide omelette onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
