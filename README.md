# Odin_Recipes
This project will showcase my basic understanding of HTML, By creating a website that displays food recipes. I learned about basic HTML boiler plate, I learned about headers, paragraphs, links, and how to add images in a webpage. I learned about the basics of CSS and added a few basic styles to every recipe page. I learned about HTML <div>. I learned what classes and ID are and how to implement them. I learned how to chain classes together. I learned about different properties that can be applied. I also learned how cascading in CSS works.
